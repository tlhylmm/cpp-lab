# C++ Lab
###### Lab codes of university until 3rd semester.

Most of the code in this repo are practices of algorithms (sorting etc.) and data structures (Stack,Queue,BST,AVLTree and so on). Nearly all of the folders given include a PDF as an objective of code. There are many projects for learning concepts such as Dynamic Memory Allocation, File I/O, Pointers, Object Oriented Programming concepts.

Folders in root directory are labs for practising operations on data structures. They include traversal algorithms, self balancing trees, simple I/O operations.

Point Cloud Mapping is a project to create a single point cloud using the different point clouds acquired from cameras that placed in different locations. It does the required matrix calculations to create a single point of view.
